  1. Closures

A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer functions variables
It has access to its own scope, outer functions scope and global scope

Example:

function showName(first, last){

  var nameIntro = "Your name is: ";

  function makeFullName(){
    return nameIntro + name + " " + last
  }


  return makeFullName();
}


Closures have access to the outer functions variables even after the outer function has returned.

Example:

function celebName(name){
  var intro = "celeb name : ";

  function lastName(theLastName){
    return intro + name + " " + theLastName;
  }

  return lastName;
}

var me = celebName("Tom"); // function has returned

me("Awesome"); // closure lastName is called and still has access to original name


Closures store references to outer functions variables, therefore if they change in the outer function
  the closure will use the current variable value.
